## Background: 	
	Researchers use the geographic location data of vessels obtained from different web sources to track the location of specific vessels and make observations on the travel paths and predict the path based on the expected weather conditions etc. Most of the web sources which track the location of vessels will have the geographic information embedded in the website front-end code to render the location using third-party map service providers such as google maps or Bing maps. Web scraping techniques it is possible to extract this embedded geographical information from the websites to maintain a data repository. In few cases the information is in the form of maps with location markers which represent the location of the vessel. A web service will serve these maps with updated location of vessels as marker periodically. In such use cases, there are no tools readily available to extract location.
